## Who Is This For?

**Fu is still in active research and lacks a useful standard library.** Unless you're a language geek, it'd be too early to consider using it. But if you are, we are looking for language designers interested in:

- IO, networking, cryptography;
- audio, video and graphics;
- numerical analysis and scientific computing;
- interpreters and abstract evaluation;
- formal software verification.

If this sounds like you, let us know! Either way, thank you for stopping by.
