## Motivation

Most modern C and C++ successor languages share a philosophy of maximum explicitness.

Generally, this design ethos results in very exact and predictable languages. However, having the programmer explicitly codify every aspect of the program implies that the entire maintenance burden is also borne by the programmer.

We explore the opposite design direction in an attempt to reduce this maintenance burden.

**We want to write as little code as possible to achieve an optimal result.**
